        <h2 class="H2">4: Dressing for Different Seasons and Climates</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Summer:</dt><br>
          <dd>In the scorching summer months, dressing comfortably and maintaining a professional appearance is crucial. Women can opt for lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen to beat the heat. A knee-length or calf-length A-line or shift dress in pastel or light shades, paired with closed-toe flats or low-heeled sandals, is a suitable choice. Accessorize minimally with stud earrings and a delicate necklace. Keep makeup light and natural to prevent it from melting in the heat. It's advisable to carry a compact hand-held fan or a small umbrella for added comfort. Don't forget to apply sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun's harsh rays.</dd><br>

          <dt>Monsoon:</dt><br>
          <dd>The monsoon season in India can bring heavy rainfall and humidity. It's essential to choose clothing that can withstand damp conditions. Opt for wrinkle-resistant materials like synthetic blends or polyester to maintain a crisp look despite the rain. Consider wearing a knee-length pencil skirt or slacks paired with a water-resistant trench coat or a blazer. Closed-toe shoes with a good grip are a must to navigate wet and slippery streets. Carry a compact, foldable umbrella to stay dry when going to and from the interview location. Keep makeup minimal and opt for a waterproof mascara and foundation to avoid smudging.</dd><br>

          <dt>Winter: </dt><br>
          <dd>Winters in India vary from mild to chilly, depending on the region. In colder climates, women should prioritize warmth while maintaining professionalism. A tailored wool or wool-blend suit in dark colors like charcoal gray or navy is an excellent choice. Pair it with a silk blouse or a turtleneck for added warmth. Don't forget to wear thermal leggings or stockings underneath to stay comfortable. Closed-toe leather ankle boots or knee-high boots with a low heel are suitable for both style and warmth. Accessorize with a simple scarf and gloves to keep cozy. A classic overcoat or a long trench coat completes the winter look.</dd><br>

          <dt>Spring/Fall:</dt><br>
          <dd>During the transitional seasons of spring and fall, the weather can be pleasant, but it's best to be prepared for variations. Choose a lightweight wool or cotton-blend blazer paired with dress slacks or a knee-length skirt. A long-sleeved blouse or a silk top in soft colors works well. Closed-toe pumps or comfortable flats are ideal footwear choices. Layering is key, so you can easily adjust to changing temperatures. Carry a lightweight cardigan or a shawl that complements your outfit. Keep your makeup fresh and natural, and pay attention to weather forecasts to adapt your attire accordingly.</dd>
        </dl>
        <br>

        <p>Remember that personal comfort and confidence are essential during interviews, so adjust your clothing choices based on the specific climate and regional variations within India. Additionally, always research the company's dress code and culture to ensure that your attire aligns with their expectations.</p>
